        There’s no way anyone could ever come between us.
        I’m sorry in advance for the little things that might affect me —
        for the silly fights I might start without meaning to.😔🥺

        But no matter how much I fight,
        please don’t let go of me.🙏🙏
        Hold me a little tighter,🤗💗
        help me understand,
        be patient with me…
        and I promise I’ll try my best not to fight — hehe 💖
