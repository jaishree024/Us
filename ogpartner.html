        I am so fucking proud of you.
        Proud of all the hardships you faced — alone,
        of every battle you fought in silence,🥺⚔️
        and every achievement you earned with nothing but sheer strength.🏆🔥

        I will always stand by your side,
        through every storm and every sunshine.
        I see the incredible human you are —
        and the even more amazing one you’re becoming.
        And I wish you nothing less than all the happiness in the world.🌍💫

        Sure, I tease you.😜 I laugh at your little quirks.
        But none of that compares to how deeply
        you inspire me every single day. ✨💖
